React
Create the Main Project directory
In your terminal, navigate to a directory where you would like to save your project. Now create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
mkdir my_awesome_project
cd my_awesome_project
Create a React App
This process is really straightforward.
I will be using Facebook’s create-react-app to… you guessed it, easily create a react app named client:
npx create-react-app client
cd client
npm start

Creating the Client with React templating
Use CORS in API to ensure that client can access API

Using Bootstrap with Client install:
npm install --save node-sass
From <https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap#using-a-custom-theme> 
To enable sass and scss files.
